# Short URL Generator Project Implementation Plan (Next.js Version)

## 1. Project Setup and Tech Stack Decision
- [x] Define project requirements and goals
- [x] Choose Next.js as the full-stack framework
- [x] Choose database: MongoDB for storing URL mappings
- [x] Set up version control: Git and GitHub repository

## 2. System Design
- [x] Design the overall system architecture
- [x] Plan the database schema for URL mappings
- [x] Design the API routes
- [x] Create a high-level component diagram
- [x] Plan for scalability and performance considerations

## 3. Next.js Project Setup
- [x] Set up a new Next.js project
- [x] Configure TypeScript (optional but recommended)
- [x] Set up MongoDB connection using Mongoose
- [x] Create database models for URL mappings

## 4. Backend Development (API Routes)
- [x] Implement API routes:
  - [x] POST route for creating short URLs
  - [x] GET route for redirecting short URLs
  - [x] GET route for retrieving URL statistics
- [x] Implement URL shortening algorithm
- [x] Add error handling and input validation
- [x] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## 5. Frontend Development
- [x] Set up global styles and theme
- [x] Create main application layout
- [x] Implement URL submission form
- [x] Display shortened URL and copy-to-clipboard functionality
- [ ] Create a list view for user's shortened URLs
- [ ] Implement basic analytics display for each URL

## 6. State Management and Data Fetching
- [ ] Set up React Query or SWR for efficient data fetching
- [ ] Implement client-side state management (if needed)

## 7. Authentication (Optional)
- [ ] Implement user authentication using Next.js Auth
- [ ] Create protected routes for user-specific features

## 8. Testing
- [ ] Set up Jest for unit and integration tests
- [ ] Write tests for API routes
- [ ] Write tests for React components
- [ ] Implement end-to-end testing using Cypress

## 9. Security Implementation
- [x] Add HTTPS support (assuming you're using Vercel or a similar platform that provides HTTPS by default)
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Add input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks

## 10. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism for frequently accessed URLs
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [x] Utilize Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- [x] Implement code splitting and lazy loading (Next.js does this by default)

## 11. Documentation
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Create a user guide for the application
- [ ] Document the system architecture and design decisions

## 12. Deployment Preparation
- [x] Set up environment variables
- [x] Configure Next.js for production build

## 13. Deployment
- [ ] Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or custom server)
- [ ] Set up production database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- [ ] Deploy the Next.js application
- [ ] Set up domain and DNS configuration

## 14. Monitoring and Maintenance
- [ ] Implement logging and error tracking (e.g., using a service like Sentry)
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Create automated backups for the database

## 15. Future Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] Implement custom short URL slugs
- [ ] Add support for URL expiration
- [ ] Implement more detailed analytics
- [ ] Create a browser extension for quick URL shortening
